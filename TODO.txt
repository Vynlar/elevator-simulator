Bugs
When arriving to a floor, both outside buttons are cleared instead of the appropriate one. (This is a FEATURE, since there is only one elevator, this is more efficient.)
Outside button lights stay on in emergency mode.

Suggested improvements
Remove outside down button on Floor 0
Remove outside up button on Floor 4
